# Unit 13 PWA Challenge: Online/Offline Rolodex App
Today, your Project Owners ask you to create a Client Rolodex app for the company. However, the backend team has not built the backend API yet, so there is no data for you to query. To add another wrench into the development cycle, your Project Owners say that they want to demo the app for the executive team using an API and want it to be a PWA.

Sounds like you have your work cut out for ya!

## User Story
AS AN employee of the company
I WANT to be able to see all clients that are in the company rolodex
AND be able to create new client records via a form
I WOULD also like to be able to view a detailed version of a client contact information via a modal on the homepage

* View a Demo [here](https://company-dex.netlify.app/)

## Requirements
* General:
  * [ ] The app should render three Pages:

  * [ ] Each page must have a Navbar that has links to:

    * [ ] `Create Record Page`
* Homepage:
  * [ ] As soon as the page has loaded (`onload`), the page should check `localStorage` to see if user data exist and render it
    * [ ] If no data exist, then the app must perform an API call to the [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) `users` endpoint and then store the returned data to `localStorage`
      * [ ] The data must be rendered from `localStorage`
  * [ ] Each user data item should be rendered in a card with the following data:
    * [ ] Client's Name
    * [ ] Client's Company Name

       * [ ] Client's Phone Number
       * [ ] Client's Username
       * [ ] Client's Website
       * [ ] The data rendered within the **models** must come from local storage
    2. [ ] Delete Contact - Onclick this button should remove the card from localStorage, the homepage, and cause a page to reload
    3. [ ] Update Contact - OnClick this should navigate the user to the `Update Contact Page`
* [ ] Create Record Page:
  * [ ] This page **must** display a form
  * [ ] On submit, the form must perform a POST request to the [jsonplaceholder](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/) API

## Commit Early and Often

* One of the most important skills to master as a web developer is version control. Building the habit of committing via Git is important for two reasons:

1. Your commit history is a signal to employers that you are actively working on projects and learning new skills

2. Your commit history allows you to revert your code base in the event that you need to return to a previous state

* Follow these guidelines for committing:

  * Make single purpose commits for related changes to ensure a clean, manageable history. If you are fixing two issues, make two commits

  * Write descriptive, meaningful commit messages so that you and anyone else looking at your repository can easily understand its history

  * Don't commit half-done work, for the sake of your collaborators (and your future self!)

  * Test your application before you commit to ensure functionality at every step in the development process

* We would like you to have well over 200 commits by graduation, so commit early and often!
